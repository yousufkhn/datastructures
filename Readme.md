## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download and install Java from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). You also need a Java IDE, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans. You can download and install your preferred IDE from their official websites.

Alternatively, you can use an online Java compiler, such as JDoodle, Repl.it, or OnlineGDB, to run the code without installing anything.

## Usage

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific topic, such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, etc. Inside each folder, you will find one or more Java files that contain the code for solving a problem related to that topic. Each Java file has a comment at the top that explains the problem statement, the input and output format, the time and space complexity, and the algorithm used.

To run the code, you can either open the Java file in your IDE and run it, or copy and paste the code into an online Java compiler and execute it. You can also modify the code to test different inputs or to implement your own solutions.

## Contribution

This repository is for my personal learning purpose, and I am not actively looking for contributors. However, if you find any bugs, errors, or improvements in the code, you are welcome to open an issue or a pull request. I appreciate any feedback or suggestions that can help me improve my coding skills and knowledge.
